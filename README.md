# This is Pagemap

It provides a visual table of contents on the right side of the screen, looking for previously specified HTML elements in the document and building a page navigation based on those elements. 

## Features:

- elements are specified in an array, which also indicates hierachy: if the browser window is not tall enough, less important elements will be hidden from the pagemap
- Pagemap should redraw if dom is changed (accordions, ajax etc.)
- Pagemap offers additional info on hover
- Elements in Pagemap can be clicked and the document will slide to that page position
- Pagemap can be styled with a simple css file
- Pagemap will run as a bookmarklet and chrome plugin

## Future features:

- set and recall bookmarks in the text
- bookmarks are saved in localstorage
